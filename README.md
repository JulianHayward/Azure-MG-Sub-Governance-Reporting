# Azure Governance Visualizer aka AzGovViz

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/JulianHayward/Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/JulianHayward/Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting)

_Do you want to get granular insights on your technical Azure Governance implementation and document it in CSV, HTML, Markdown, and JSON?_

Azure Governance Visualizer is a PowerShell based script that iterates through your Azure Tenant's Management Group hierarchy, starting from the root Management Group down to the Subscription, Resource Group and Resource level. It collects data from various Azure APIs including Azure ARM, Microsoft Graph and Storage.

From the collected data it generates enriched insights for capabilities such as Azure Policy, RBAC, and a lot more.

Within an HTML output it provides visibility on your **HierarchyMap**, creates a **TenantSummary**, creates **DefinitionInsights** and builds granular **ScopeInsights** on Azure Management Groups and Subscriptions.

Further, CSV exports with enriched information per capability will be generated and detailed JSON files are exported which document your entire Azure tenant setup for Management Groups, Subscriptions, Azure RBAC definitions and assignments, Azure policy definitions and assignments. These exports come in handy for change tracking scenarios as well as redeployment of configuration (e.g. tenant migration scenario) and can even serve as a backup.

The technical requirements as well as the required permissions are minimal.

You can run the script either for your tenant root management group or any other management group.

## Mission

"_Governance can be a complex thing_.."

Challenges:

- Holistic overview on governance implementation
- Connecting the dots

Azure Governance Visualizer is intended to help you to get a holistic overview on your technical Azure Governance implementation by **connecting the dots**.

## Trust

_How can we trust a 20k lines PowerShell script?_ Besides assuring that Azure Governance Visualizer will not harm at any intent, you may want to secure yourself. Let's use Azure built-in capabilities such as VM Insights to monitor the Azure Governance Visualizer activity.

Setup a Virtual Machine in Azure, deploy the dependency agent extension and [execute](setup.md#set-up-and-run-azure-governance-visualizer-from-the-console) Azure Governance Visualizer.

In the Azure Portal navigate to the Virtual Machine, Click on **Insights** in the **Monitoring** section and click on Map. All connections that have been established will be shown. Now let's focus on the process **pwsh** and review the established connections.

![Insights on pwsh](img/insights_map_pwsh.png)

Query for Log Analytics:

```kusto
VMConnection
| where AgentId =~ '<GUID>'
| where ProcessName =~ 'pwsh'
| summarize by DestinationIp, DestinationPort, RemoteIp, Protocol, Direction, RemoteDnsQuestions, BytesSent, BytesReceived
```

## Integrate with AzOps

Did you know you can run AzOps from Azure DevOps? Check [AzOps accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps-Accelerator).
You can integrate Azure Governance Visualizer (same project as AzOps).

```yaml
pipelines:
  - pipeline: "Push"
    source: "AzOps - Push"
    trigger:
      branches:
        include:
          - master
```

## Integrate PSRule for Azure

**Pausing 'PSRule for Azure' integration**. Azure Governance Visualizer used the Invoke-PSRule cmdlet, but there are certain [resource types](https://github.com/Azure/PSRule.Rules.Azure/blob/ab0910359c1b9826d8134041d5ca997f6195fc58/src/PSRule.Rules.Azure/PSRule.Rules.Azure.psm1#L1582) where also child resources need to be queried to achieve full rule evaluation.

Let's use [PSRule for Azure](https://azure.github.io/PSRule.Rules.Azure) and use over 260 pre-built rules to validate Azure resources based on the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework (WAF) principles.
PSRule for Azure is listed as [security monitoring tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/monitor-tools) in the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework.

Parameter: `-DoPSRule` (e.g. `.\pwsh\AzGovVizParallel.ps1 -DoPSRule`)
Optional parameters:

- `-PSRuleVersion` - Define the PSRule..Rules.Azure PowerShell module version, if undefined then 'latest' will be used
- `-PSRuleFailedOnly` - PSRule for Azure will only report on failed resource (may save some space/noise). (e.g. `.\pwsh\AzGovVizParallel.ps1 -DoPSRule -PSRuleFailedOnly`)

Outputs:

- HTML (summarized)
  - TenantSummary
  - ScopeInsights
    - Management Group (all resources below that scope)
    - Subscription
- CSV (detailed, per resource)

TenantSummary HTML output example:

## Stats

In order to better understand the Azure Governance Visualizer usage and to optimize the product accordingly some stats will be ingested to Azure Application Insights. Results of stats analysis may be shared at a later stage.

### How / What?

If the script is run in Azure DevOps then the repository ID and executing principal's object ID will be used to create an unique identifier.
If the script is not run in Azure DevOps then the tenant ID and executing principal's object ID will be used to create an unique identifier.

SHA384/512 hashed combination of:

- portion of the repositoryId/tenantId
  - if repositoryId/tenantId starts with a letter then use characters 3-8 (6 characters) of the first GUID's block, combine them with the third GUID's block of the principal's objectId (4 characters), SHA512 hash them as identifier0
  - if repositoryId/tenantId starts with a number then use characters 7-12 (6 characters) of the last GUID's block, combine them with the second GUID's block of the principal's objectId (4 characters), SHA384 hash them as identifier0
- portion of the executing principal's objectId
  - if objectId starts with a letter then use characters 3-8 (6 characters) of the first GUID's block, combine them with the third GUID's block of the repositoryId/tenantId (4 characters), SHA512 hash them as identifier1
  - if objectId starts with a number then use characters 7-12 (6 characters) of the last GUID's block, combine them with the second GUID's block of the repositoryId/tenantId (4 characters), SHA384 hash them as identifier1

Combine identifier0 and identifier1

- if objectId starts with a letter then combine identifiers -> 'identifier0 + identifier1', SHA512 hash them as final identifier and remove dashes (string of 128 characters)
- if objectId starts with a number then combine identifiers -> 'identifier1 + identifier0', SHA512 hash them as final identifier and remove dashes (string of 128 characters)

To conclude the approach: taking 6 or 4 characters from tenant ID / respository ID and object ID of the executing principal to create a unique identifier, which may not be backward resolveable.

![identifier](img/identifier.jpg)

The following data will be ingested to Azure Application Insights:

```text
"accType": "ServicePrincipal / User (member) / User (Guest)",
"azCloud": "Azure environment e.g. AzureCloud, ChinaCloud, etc.",
"identifier": "8c62a7..53d08c0 (string of 128 characters)",
"platform": "Console / AzureDevOps",
"productVersion": "used Azure Governance Visualizer version",
"psAzAccountsVersion": "used Az.Accounts PS module version",
"psVersion": "used PowerShell version",
"scopeUsage": "childManagementGroup / rootManagementGroup",
"statsCountErrors": "count of encountered errors",
"statsCountSubscriptions": "less than 100 / more than 100 (no exact numbers)",
"statsParametersDoNotIncludeResourceGroupsAndResourcesOnRBAC": "true / false",
"statsParametersDoNotIncludeResourceGroupsOnPolicy": "true / false",
"statsParametersDoNotShowRoleAssignmentsUserData": "true / false",
"statsParametersHierarchyMapOnly": "true / false",
"statsParametersLargeTenant": "true / false",
"statsParametersNoASCSecureScore" "true / false",
"statsParametersNoAzureConsumption": "true / false",
"statsParametersNoJsonExport": "true / false",
"statsParametersNoPolicyComplianceStates": "true / false",
"statsParametersNoResourceProvidersDetailed": "true / false",
"statsParametersNoResources": "true / false",
"statsParametersPolicyAtScopeOnly": "true / false",
"statsParametersRBACAtScopeOnly": "true / false",
"statsTry": "count of try sending to Application Insights"
```

Thank you for your support!

## Security

&#9995; **Take care**: Azure Governance Visualizer creates very detailed information about your Azure Governance setup. In your organization's best interest the **outputs should be protected from not authorized access!**

&#9757; **Be aware**: Any _member_ user of the tenant can execute/run the script against the management group (and below) if the _member_ user has the Azure RBAC role 'Reader' assigned at management froup (this of course also applies for the root management group). More important: also _guest_ users can execute/run the script if your tenant is not hardened (and has the RBAC role 'Reader' assigned at management group) **Microsoft Entra Id | External Identities | External collaboration settings | Guest user access** [ref](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/users/users-restrict-guest-permissions)

🛡️ **Collaborate with the security team**: Azure Defender for Cloud may alert Azure Governance Visualizer resource queries as suspicious activity:

![Microsoft defender for Cloud security alert](img/azgvz_MDfC_securityAlert.png)

## Known issues

Working with Git and Windows cloning from your AzDO repository you may experience the following error:

```output
fatal: cannot create directory at 'output/JSON_...': Filename too long
```

To work around that issue you may want to enable longpaths support.
**Note the [caveats](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/8023)!**

```shell
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

## Facts

Disabled Azure subscriptions and subscriptions where Quota ID starts with with "AAD\_" are being skipped, all others are queried. More information on Subscription Quota ID / Offer numbers: [Supported Microsoft Azure offers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data#supported-microsoft-azure-offers).

ARM Limits are not acquired programmatically, these are hardcoded. The links used to check related limits are commented in the param section of the script.
