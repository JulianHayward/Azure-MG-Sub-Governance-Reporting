# AzGovViz - Azure Governance Visualizer

Do you want to get granular insights on your technical Azure Governance implementation? - document it in CSV, HTML, Markdown and JSON?  
AzGovViz is a PowerShell based script that iterates your Azure Tenant´s Management Group hierarchy down to Subscription level. It captures most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, RBAC and Blueprints and a lot more. From the collected data AzGovViz provides visibility on your __HierarchyMap__, creates a __TenantSummary__, creates __DefinitionInsights__ and builds granular __ScopeInsights__ on Management Groups and Subscriptions. The technical requirements as well as the required permissions are minimal.

You can run the script either for your Tenant Root Group or any other Management Group.

## AzGovViz´s mission

<table>
<td>

"_Governance can be a complex thing_.."

Challenges:

 * Holistic overview on governance implementation  
 * Connecting the dots

__AzGovViz is intended to help you to get a holistic overview on your technical Azure Governance implementation by connecting the dots__

## AzGovViz release history

__Changes__ (2021-May-19)

* Removed Azure PowerShell module requirement Az.ResourceGraph 
* __TenantSummary__ 'Change tracking' section. Tracks newly created and updated custom Policy, PolicySet and RBAC Role definitions, Policy/RBAC Role assignments and Resources that occured within the last 14 days (period can be adjusted using new parameter `-ChangeTrackingDays`)
* New parameters `-PolicyIncludeResourceGroups` and `-RBACIncludeResourceGroupsAndResources` - include Policy assignments on ResourceGroups, include Role assignments on ResourceGroups and Resources
* New parameters `-PolicyAtScopeOnly` and `-RBACAtScopeOnly` - removing 'inherited' lines in the HTML file; use this parameter if you run against a larger tenants
* New parameter `-CsvExport` - export enriched data for 'Role assignments', 'Policy assignments' data and 'all resources' (subscriptionId, managementGroup path, resourceType, id, name, location, tags, createdTime, changedTime)
* !_experimental_ New parameter `-JsonExport`- export of ManagementGroup Hierarchy including all MG/Sub Policy/RBAC definitions, Policy/RBAC assignments and some more relevant information to JSON
* Added ClassicAdministrators Role assignment information
* Restructure __TenantSummary__ - Limits gets its own section
* Added sytem metadata for Policy/RBAC definitions and assignments
* New parameter `-FileTimeStampFormat`- define the time format for the output files (default is `yyyyMMdd_HHmmss`)
* Updated API error codes
* Cosmetics / Icons
* Bugfixes
* Performance optimization

* Requires PowerShell Az Modules
  * Az.Accounts
  * Az.Resources
  * ~~Az.ResourceGraph~~
  * [Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)
* Usage
  * `.\AzGovVizParallel.ps1 -ManagementGroupId <your-Management-Group-Id>`
* Parameters
  * `-ManagementGroupId` Tenant Id or any child Management Group Id
  * `-CsvDelimiter` the world is split into two kind of delimiters - comma and semicolon - choose yours
  * `-OutputPath`
  * `-AzureDevOpsWikiAsCode`
  * `-DoNotShowRoleAssignmentsUserData` scrub personally identifiable information (PII)
  * `-LimitCriticalPercentage` limit warning level, default is 80%
  * ~~`-HierarchyTreeOnly`~~ `-HierarchyMapOnly` output only the __HierarchyMap__ for Management Groups including linked Subscriptions
  * `-SubscriptionQuotaIdWhitelist` process only Subscriptions with defined QuotaId(s)
  * `-NoResourceProvidersDetailed` disables output for ResourceProvider states for all Subscriptions in the __TenantSummary__ section, in large Tenants this can become time consuming
  * `-NoASCSecureScore` disables ASC Secure Score request for Subscriptions. The used API is in preview you may want to disable this
  * ~~`-DisablePolicyComplianceStates`~~ `-NoPolicyComplianceStates` will not query policy compliance states. You may want to use this parameter to accellerate script execution or when receiving error 'ResponseTooLarge'. 
  * `-NoResourceDiagnosticsPolicyLifecycle` disables Resource Diagnostics Policy Lifecycle recommendations
  * `-NoAADGroupsResolveMembers` disables resolving Azure Active Directory Group memberships
  * `-NoAADGuestUsers` disables resolving Azure Active Directory User type (Guest or Member)

  * `-AzureConsumptionPeriod` define for which time period Azure Consumption data should be gathered; default is 1 day
  * `-NoAzureConsumptionReportExportToCSV` Azure Consumption data should not be exported (CSV)
  * `-NoScopeInsights` - Q: Why would you want to do this? A: In larger tenants the ScopeInsights section blows up the html file (up to unusable due to html file size)
  * `-ThrottleLimit` - leveraging PowerShell´s parallel capability you can define the ThrottleLimit (default=5; &#x1F4A1; values from 5 up to 15 proved to perform best)
  * `-DoTranscript` - log the console output
  * `-SubscriptionId4AzContext` - Define the Subscription Id to use for AzContext (default is to use a random Subscription Id)
  * `-PolicyAtScopeOnly` - removing 'inherited' lines in the HTML file for 'Policy Assignments'; use this parameter if you run against a larger tenants
  * `-RBACAtScopeOnly` - removing 'inherited' lines in the HTML file for 'Role Assignments'; use this parameter if you run against a larger tenants
  * `-CsvExport` - export enriched data for 'Role assignments', 'Policy assignments' data and 'all resources' (subscriptionId,  managementGroup path, resourceType, id, name, location, tags, createdTime, changedTime)
  * `-PolicyIncludeResourceGroups` - include Policy assignments on ResourceGroups
  * `-RBACIncludeResourceGroupsAndResources` - include Role assignments on ResourceGroups and Resources
  * `-ChangeTrackingDays` - define the period for Change tracking on newly created and updated custom Policy, PolicySet and RBAC Role definitions and Policy/RBAC Role assignments (default is '14')

#### Azure DevOps Pipeline

The provided example Pipeline is configured to run based on a [schedule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/scheduled-triggers) (every 12 hours). It will push the AzGovViz markdown output file to the 'wiki' folder in the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository which will feed your Wiki.

1. In Azure DevOps make sure to [enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/navigation/preview-features?view=azure-devops&tabs=new-account-enabled) the Multistage Pipelines feature <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/multi-stage-pipelines-experience?view=azure-devops>
2. Clone the AzGovViz Repo
3. Create Pipeline, configure your pipeline selecting __Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file__, select the AzGovViz YAML from the AzGovViz (Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting) Repo
4. Grant Repository permissions: In order to allow the pipeline to push files back to our 'wiki' folder in the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository the __Build Service__ Account ('%ProjectName% Build Service (%OrgName%)') must be granted with __Contribute__ permission  
![alt text](img/AzDO_Repo-Permissions.png "example output")
5. Run the Pipeline
6. Create Wiki by choosing [Publish Code as Wiki](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/publish-repo-to-wiki?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser), define the folder 'wiki' from the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository as source

> Make sure your Service Connection´s Service Principal has been granted with the required permissions (see [__Required permissions in Azure Active Directory__](#required-permissions-in-azure-active-directory)).

## AzGovViz sidenotes

### Security

AzGovViz creates very detailed information about your Azure Governance setup. In your organization's best interest the __outputs should be protected from not authorized access!__

### Facts

Disabled Subscriptions and Subscriptions where Quota Id starts with with "AAD_" are being skipped, all others are queried. More info on Quota Id / Offer numbers: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data#supported-microsoft-azure-offers" target="_blank">Supported Microsoft Azure offers</a> 
.  

ARM Limits are not acquired programmatically, they are hardcoded. The links used to check related Limits are commented in the param section of the script.
